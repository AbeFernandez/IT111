Set the turn number to 1

# Let the user enter die roll values from a command line. This will allow for controlled
test data. Eventually, we can convert the die roll to a pseudorandom number for game
simulations.

#Validate data entry by throwing an error for numerical input <2 or >12.

Die roll is a number from 2 to 12

If turn number = 1 and die roll = 2, 3, or 12, player loses

If turn number = 1 and die roll = 7 or 11, player wins

else if turn number = 1 and die roll not = 2, 3, 7, 11, or 12, point number = die roll and turn number += 1

Print the turn number, the die roll and the result.

# The section below will become a loop to extend the game. We will work on the loop next
week. The loop functionality is not required for this week's assignment.

Die roll is a new number from 2 to 12

# Let the user enter die roll values from a command line. This will allow for controlled
test data. Eventually, we can convert the die roll to a pseudorandom number for game
simulations.

#Validate data entry by throwing an error for numerical input <2 or >12.

If turn number > 1 and die roll = 7 player loses

If turn number > 1 and die roll = point number player wins

Else turn number +=1

Print the turn number, the die roll and the result.
